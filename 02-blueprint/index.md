Itâ€™s your single org-wide pane to view and manage your service information and team allocations. It can be used as:

- **Single source of truth**: Service, team allocations with metadata and links
- Establishing **ownership and accountability** for each service

It aims to become the blueprint of your microservice architecture. Our aim is to make storing and retrieving information about your microservices easy & usable for building further automations. Imagine IAM for your microservices

The entities being tracked in the registry at the moment are services, teams & their relationships. As the features grow we plan to cover many other entities, which are involved in a distributed architecture.
