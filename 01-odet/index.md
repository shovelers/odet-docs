# Welcome to Odet!

Odet is a microservice management platform.

Some of the most common issues that arise when you run a microservices based architecture at scale are:
- Unclear service ownership
- Lack of inter-team Standardization & Best Practices
- Tribal Knowledge, leading to onboarding of new team members become a first-class problem

Odetâ€™s mission is to help you manage the complexities involved in scaling engineering at pace with your business. We do this through two key modules:
- **Blueprint** (service catalogue): A single org-wide appstore defining service architecture, ownership & accountability, and
- **Workbench** (service excellence): Platform to define and shape engineering practices to ensure continuity and standardization
